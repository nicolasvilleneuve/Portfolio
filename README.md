## Portfolio
The website which is meant to provide a link to everything that I have done. 

## Description 
This directory is simply my portfolio website. 
There are an awful lot of commits as each page of the website has been contunually added to on a constant basis, since its inception. Whether it be adding functionality, stylizing, or cleaning up the code. 

## Usage 
You can access the website itself trhough the github pages link (nicolasvilleneuve.github.io/Portfolio) or, to mka euse of the back-end server I created with Flask, you can access the website via pythonanywhere (nicolasvilleneuve.pythonanywhere.com). 
As I am developing an understanding of Django, I will certainly update to include a Heroku link soon.

## Contributing
If you would like to create a PULL request, please feel free. Whether the intent be to pilfer from the code as you like some elements of the site, or to suggest improvements, you are most welcome to. If the changes are to be major, however, please open an issue first so we can discuss if/what you would like to change. 
Should you have a problem in doing so, please feel free to let me know (my email is on my website so please find it there).
